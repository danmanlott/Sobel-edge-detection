# Sobel-edge-detection
A c program that finds edges of objects in an image by performing a sobel filter on with differing threshold levels

Run by clicking the "buildRun" batch file.

Source is sobel.c
input image is garb34.pgm
low threshold image is outLo.pgm
high threshold image is outHi.pgm
middle threshold image is output.pgm

I know that IrfanView and XnView can view the pgm files
